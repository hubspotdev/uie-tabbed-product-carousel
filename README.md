# Tabbed Product Carousel

A HubSpot UI Extensions app card that displays product information in a tabbed interface with an image carousel, allowing users to browse through device specifications and photos.

## Overview

This [private app card](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/guides/crm/private-apps/creating-private-apps) built with UI Extensions combines a dynamic photo carousel with a tabbed interface that displays device information in list format.


### Project Structure

The main extension logic lives in `src/app/extensions/ProductRecord.tsx`, which is the entry point and container component. The UI is broken down into components stored in the `components` directory, including:

- `PhotoCarousel` for dynamic photo carousel
- `ProductSpecsTabs` for the description lists containing device specs and information

## Installing the App Card

### Requirements

There are a few things that must be set up before you can make use of this project.

* You must have an active HubSpot account.
* You must have the [HubSpot CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hubspot/cli) installed and set up.
* You must have access to developer projects (developer projects are currently [in public beta under "CRM Development Tools"](https://app.hubspot.com/l/whats-new/betas)).


### Running the HubSpot Private App Locally


1. Initialize the project to generate the `hubspot.config.yml` file which contains the account information needed to run the project. Follow the prompts, select your developer account, and generate a personal access key.

3. Navigate to the app card extensions directory (`src/app/extensions`) and install the dependencies.
